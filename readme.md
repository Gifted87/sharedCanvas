## Features

- **Collaborative Canvas**: Share a canvas with multiple devices connected to the same local network.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes made by one user are instantly reflected on all connected devices.
- **File Uploads**: Drag and drop files or upload them directly to the canvas.
- **Text and Image Support**: Add text, images, and files to the canvas with ease.
- **Bookmarks**: Save and navigate to specific sections of the canvas.
- **Minimap**: View the entire canvas and navigate quickly using the minimap.
- **Search and Filter**: Search for items by name, tags, or type.
- **Tag Management**: Add, edit, and remove tags for better organization.
- **Offline-First Design**: Works without an internet connection; only requires a local network.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Access the canvas from any device with a browser by scanning a QR code or entering the local IP address.
- **History Navigation**: Undo and redo navigation actions with history buttons.

## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. Launch the app by running `npm start` or by opening the executable if youâ€™ve built the app.
2. Upon startup, the app will check for an active local network connection. If no network is detected, the app will display an error and exit.

### Connecting Devices

1. Once the app is running, it will display a QR code and a local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`).
2. Other devices on the same network can connect by:
   - Scanning the QR code.
   - Entering the IP address in their browser.

### Interacting with the Canvas

- **Add Items**:
  - Drag and drop files onto the canvas.
  - Use the "Paste" button to add text.
  - Use the "Upload" button to add files.
- **Move and Resize**:
  - Drag items to reposition them.
  - Resize items by dragging their edges (if supported).
- **Tag Management**:
  - Right-click an item and select "Edit Tags" to add or remove tags.
- **Search and Filter**:
  - Use the search bar to find items by name or tags.
- **Bookmarks**:
  - Save the current view using the "Save View" button.
  - Navigate to saved views using the bookmarks dropdown.

### Exiting the Application

- Close the app window to exit.
- The app will automatically save the canvas state and clean up temporary files.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**:
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 10.15 or later
  - Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
- **Hardware**:
  - Minimum 4GB RAM
  - Dual-core processor
- **Network**:
  - Local network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)

## Application Structure

The app is organized into the following key components:

### Main Process

- **`index.js`**:
  - Handles the Electron app lifecycle.
  - Manages the main application window.
  - Starts the embedded Node.js server.

### Server

- **`server.js`**:
  - Manages the backend logic using Express and Socket.IO.
  - Handles file uploads, state persistence, and real-time communication.

### Renderer Process

- **`public/index.html`**:
  - The main HTML file for the app's frontend.
- **`public/client.js`**:
  - Contains the client-side JavaScript for canvas interactions, socket communication, and UI updates.
- **`public/style.css`**:
  - Defines the styles for the app's user interface.

### Preload Script

- **`preload.js`**:
  - Exposes safe APIs to the renderer process using Electron's `contextBridge`.

---

## How It Works

1. **Startup**:
   - The Electron app initializes and starts a local server using server.js.
   - The server serves the frontend files and handles WebSocket connections.

2. **Canvas Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the canvas through the browser or the Electron app window.
   - Actions like adding items, moving items, or editing tags are sent to the server via WebSocket.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - The server broadcasts updates to all connected clients, ensuring real-time synchronization.

4. **State Persistence**:
   - The canvas state is saved to a JSON file (`canvas_state.json`) when the app exits.
   - On startup, the app loads the saved state to restore the canvas.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Network Connection Detected**:
   - Ensure your device is connected to a local network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
   - Restart the app after connecting to the network.

2. **Cannot Connect from Other Devices**:
   - Ensure all devices are on the same local network.
   - Check your firewall settings to allow connections on port `3000`.

3. **Files Not Uploading**:
   - Ensure the uploads directory exists and is writable.
   - Check the file size limit (default: 100GB).

4. **Canvas Not Loading**:
   - Check the console logs for errors.
   - Ensure the canvas_state.json file is not corrupted.

### Logs

- Logs are printed to the console for debugging purposes.
- Check the terminal or command prompt for detailed error messages.
